 Someone once complained to me that there is no simple cli http/2 file server for testing (and such). This is currently just a http/1 PoLA file server. But it made me wonder if there is no such thing (apparently) in crates.io because it is "too obvious"... or "in the way" or...? Does not rust need a good local development web server?
