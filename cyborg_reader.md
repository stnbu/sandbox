* auto-pagination
* simple css interface (that security something) e.g. you upload a single css fragment as part of your (book's) profile.

thingie
* your settings are all just cookie based. you can export and save them or something, but there is no logging in of any kind **
* same with user-suppled (contrast author-supplied) css and simple preferences and and can be zipped up as a you-own-it portable config.
* the ability to right-click anywhere and just say "yo author" (no comments) or an dead-easy box to write your comment. "don't say this".
* also, selecting text and right-click should drop you into an edit with the selected text "quoted" above
* should be able to "print" (pdf) any book and have it come out just like it looks when using the site the usual way. zactly

### um

If it serves ipfs, then we can forget all about storage costs or complexity. just support "obvious-distribued-file-thing" and nothing else.

It could even be bittorent: there will be no goddamn intellectual property hindrances with any of this. we have zero lawyers and doin't plan to hire any. maybe the web server is willing to go and fetch bittorent content for you, within reason (ddos??)

You post it: It's no longer "just yours".

### Wait, wait!

The file format can just /be/ PDF. we take some text input, output pdfs and invite people to enjoy. with some sense of "identity".
* Problem: what about handling footnotes, hyperlinks, appendix references... can it be done... /nicely/?
* If so, I think that settles everytinggg. maybe. experiment with outputting pdf and you (me) will find out!

maybe 'on blockchain' you pay just a bit of crypto to get the server to create a PDF. if it's 100x the cost of the actual resources, then it'd be $0.08 or something. folks would pay...."if micropayments"

COSTS:
* Grab you a torrent file of text [how check]
* Let you upload some text (which we will store but probably forget about eventually)
* Let you point to an article online somewhere (url)
* (optionally) store it on ipfs so we "will always have a copy of the orig"
* output (optionally?) a pdf for your viewing pleasure
* tally all the above costs and charge you, the "product" being a pdf you can read yourself, link people to, etc. but hey, if it disappears it disappears. one thing we are not (maybe we are) storing for is charging!
* cha-ching: bill your polygon/optimism/ethereum/something wallet. bing. boom. muny.
